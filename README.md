- ### Memoized API Call
      The app memoizes the API call, hence avoiding overhead on the server.

- ### Debounced Search
      In order to improve the performance and the user experience of the search, I have added a debounce to the search.

- ### Cypress Testing
      To have an hassle free development and release, I have integreated Cypress for e2e testing of the app, ensuring the stability of the app.
